## 🏆 The Idea Behind ANIS

**ANIS** was born from a simple yet powerful idea: *What if finding the perfect sports partner or group was as easy as opening an app?* 

In a world where people often struggle to find others who share their passion for sports, ANIS creates a bridge between athletes of all levels. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn tennis, an intermediate player seeking a volleyball team, or an advanced footballer wanting competitive matches, ANIS connects you with the right people at the right time.

Our mascot, **Hoopoe** 🐦, represents the spirit of connection and community that drives our platform. Just as the Hoopoe bird is known for bringing messages and connecting distant places, ANIS brings together athletes who might never have met otherwise.

This location-based sports networking platform was developed as part of the **Apple Developer Academy Summer Foundation Program**, showcasing modern iOS development practices and the beautiful liquid glass UI design that makes every interaction feel magical.

## 🚀 Development Process

This project was developed using modern iOS development practices and tools:

- **Xcode & SwiftUI**: Primary development environment for iOS app creation
- **Git Version Control**: Systematic tracking of development progress
- **Cursor AI Assistant**: Used as a development assistant to accelerate coding, provide architecture suggestions, and maintain code quality throughout the project

The development process emphasized clean architecture, accessibility, and following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines to create a polished, professional application.
